random color maze/labrinth (wip)

duality ideas:
math- points and planes

[x] make 2d grid
[x] allow movement in grid
[] allow turning
[x] limit movement options depending on what paths can be taken
[x] ensure player cannot get trapped (allow wrap-around)
[] tell player what directions they can and cant go
[] turn grid into randomly generanted maze
[x] have rooms be a packaged scene that is customizable
[] add player stats (health and attack or smth)
[] add combat and puzzles(the map is the puzzle)
[] add random loot
[] add music
[] display pos?
[] create main menu (size option, start and exit buttons)

get all magic items/keys then get to the center
there are two sets of keys you need: one is flesh/nature themed and the other is metal/synthetic

handmade levels

[color = where you are
sections or rooms are colored
floor and cleiling tell where you are
and walls tell where you can go]
